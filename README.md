Hangman code for the REACH program

Run the code.

Type hang_man() to start a game.

This code will give you a word based upon the difficulty level you request. This difficulty level is from the API difficulty definition, which to be honest, is different from my difficulty definition, but I wasn't going to fight it.

You will be able to see the length of your word, you remaining guesses, and what you have guessed in the past.

You get six chances. As you guess wrong, the situation of your man becomes more and more perilous.

If you guess correctly, you live! And you spell a word!

A scoreboard will show the top ten players' scores.

The higher the difficulty level, the more points you can get.

Guessing the same letter again will not decrease your number of turns. However, this code will also get annoyed with you if you do it too much.

If you want to run on admin level for debugging, type "admin" for difficulty. It will display the word "zebra" before you start to play. Hint: The word is zebra. You get no points playing on admin level.
